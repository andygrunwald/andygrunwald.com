**tl;dr**: We built custom game show buzzers, wrote a WebSocket server, and connected them to various applications.
Finally, we documented and open-sourced everything. Check out the **things with buzzers** series _[hardware](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-hardware "things with buzzers hardware at GitHub")_, _[websocket](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-websocket "things with buzzers WebSocket software at GitHub")_ and a frontend like _[Jeopardy!](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-jeopardy "things with buzzers Jeopardy! game software at GitHub")_.
Start today, and build your own!

## Why we did it

Every year, between Christmas and New Year's Eve, the [Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en/ "Chaos Computer Club") is running their conference called [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/ "Chaos Communication Congress").
An inspiring event with a lot of exciting and insightful content.
For many attendees, one session is their yearly highlight: [Hacker Jeopardy](https://media.ccc.de/search/?q=Hacker+Jeopardy "Hacker Jeopardy at Chaos Communication Congress").
A self-built version of the popular game show [_Jeopardy!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy! "Jeopardy! at Wikipedia") with a modified set of answers/questions to target the hacker audience.

Inspired by this, I had two motivational goals:

1. to build the same and **to have fun with friends** and colleagues
2. to **combine software** (a field I know) **with hardware** (an area I don't know) and create something real

The idea slept for a long time.
On the 1st of December 2017, I remembered it and ordered [four big red buzzers](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07F9W55FX/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07F9W55FX&linkId=59ed8f2e2dc0a14374e5dadce1705d2f).
Nothing happened again for some time until my employer ([trivago](https://www.trivago.com/ "trivago")) announced an internal tech conference planned for March 2019.

This was the chance!
I motivated my two friends [Lars](https://twitter.com/derebbe "Lars HeÃŸ at twitter") and [Matthias](https://endler.dev "Matthias Endler's website"), and we gave it a shot!

## How it works

    alt="things with buzzers: Architecture diagram of how the single parts play together."
    title="things with buzzers: Architecture diagram of how the single parts play together." />

We split the project into three parts: _(1) frontends_, _(2) websocket_, and the _(3) hardware_.

The _[(3) hardware](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-hardware "things with buzzers hardware at GitHub")_ part contains the actual buzzers, the cables, and a custom printed circuit board (PCB).
The buzzers connect via USB sockets to a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/ "Raspberry Pi") (Pi).
A PCB was built and placed onto the GPIO of the Pi (a so-called _hat_).

The _[(2) websocket](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-websocket "things with buzzers WebSocket software at GitHub")_ part is a software installed on the Pi.
It does two things:

1. Listen to the GPIO for signals and transforms them into "a buzzer was pushed" activity.
2. Host a webserver to serve static files and a WebSocket server to push out the buzzer-push signals to clients.

The _(1) frontends_ (e.g., [Jeopardy!](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-jeopardy "things with buzzers Jeopardy game software at GitHub") or [a sports competition scoreboard](https://github.com/andygrunwald/things-with-buzzers-sports-competition "things with buzzers fitness competition scoreboard at GitHub")) can be either static single-page apps served by the webserver or applications written in a language of your choice installed on the Pi.
The Pi itself either opens its wireless network or will be configured to join an existing one.
A laptop connects to the webserver and provides the game to the audience via a projector.

## Build your own

I **documented everything and open-sourced it**!

## Building them

With a little bit of preparation, we met at Lars' home on the 15th of January 2019 to get things going.
Here are a few insights:

## Credits

A big **thank you** to [Lars](https://twitter.com/derebbe "Lars HeÃŸ at twitter") and [Matthias](https://twitter.com/matthiasendler "Matthias Endler at twitter").
Without them, this project would not happen.
Lars has designed and built the complete hardware.
Matthias helped a lot with the software and motivation part. ðŸ˜€
