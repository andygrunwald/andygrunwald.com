At [Apr 19, 2013](https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commit/b44dd91e359ad55478919cc94278d26fffbdde03 "Initial commit of the Jacobine project at GitHub") I started [TYPO3-Analytics](https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine "Jacobine at GitHub") to create a prototype or proof of concept to make my first steps in fields data mining/software repository mining, statistics, and data visualization.

At this time, I got an extensive and in-depth knowledge of the [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/ "TYPO3 Content Management System") ecosystem (code, people, tools, systems, processes, events, etc.) and the TYPO3 community manager [Ben van 't ende](https://ben.vanten.de/ "Website of Ben vant Ende") motivated me to create some metrics ;)
So the first project was TYPO3.

For a GitHub repository, you need a name.
I was in the situation to name my proof of concept.
Due to the topics above and the missing flash of inspiration, I chose *TYPO3-Analytics*.
From my point of view this name does not fit anymore for some reasons:

1. The project aims to use publicly available information over centralized / standard ways (e.g., APIs). With this in mind, it is possible to analyze various projects. Not only TYPO3. The prefix *TYPO3* is not necessary and might be lead to confusion if, e.g. [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony "Symfony PHP Framework at GitHub") will be analyzed.
2. The complete project is much more than Analytics. It is about ...
* to collect and receive data
* produce new information and knowledge about this data with the usage of algorithms of data, web and text mining
* visualize data and activity in various ways
* motivate people to more open source works
* say thank you for the wow effect of what a single person has achieved
* and much more

These are only two reasons.
But I think that these are two excellent reasons to choose a new name for this baby.
And this is the time where YOUR innovation comes in.
We are looking for a new name with your help.
Here are some keywords which might be related to this project:

* data
* open source
* people
* contributor
* data / web / text mining
* software repository mining
* metrics
* statistics
* visualization
* wow
* motivation
* information
* knowledge
* community
* results
* numbers
* Your keyword here ...

I tried various startup name generators to get ideas for a new, fresh and fancy, or usable and logical name.
But I was not successful.
Maybe you got some ideas?
EVERY idea is welcome.
New keywords are welcome, too.
Would you mind posting your idea in the comments or sending a tweet to my account [@andygrunwald](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald "Andy Grunwald at twitter")?

The first idea came from [Michael Oehlhof](https://twitter.com/michadu_typo3 "Michael Oehlhof at twitter"): *TYPO3 CoMet* - CoMet means Community Metrics.
Not bad this idea.
But the TYPO3 prefix is already there, and Community metrics are a bit general.
Or what do you think? Your opinion is welcome too.
But anyway.
Thanks for this idea, Michael!

Thanks for your help!
