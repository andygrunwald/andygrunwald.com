+++

Today i tagged and released version [v0.0.1](https://github.com/andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics/releases/tag/v0.0.1) of the project [TYPO3-Analytics](https://github.com/andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics).
After [303 days](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=19&m1=4&y1=2013&d2=15&m2=2&y2=2014&ti=on) and [144 commits](https://github.com/andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics/commits/v0.0.1) later, i decided to make a "cut" and start a new version.

This version is a first (workable as far as I know) "proof of concept" for a repository mining platform to produce (community) metrics of various systems.
The first example system is [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/).

# What will be tackled in the next version?

There is no concrete roadmap for the next version(s).
And I do not know which version number will it be.
Maybe a new minor, perhaps a new major version.
The next version of TYPO3-Analytics will focus on:

* code quality
* testing
* stability
* flexibility
* documentation

This means that I try to refactor some code, create unit and integration tests, try to tackle some bugs and "unused" concepts to make a better use of existing functionality (e.g. [RabbitMQ Dead Lettering](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html)) and to add more parameter to messages to decouple the existing consumer from the proof of concept TYPO3.

Furthermore, I want to write more documentation and some blog posts about the architecture and concept of this project. I got the hope to find more contributor or to find more people who are interested in it. Maybe it will help. We will see.
