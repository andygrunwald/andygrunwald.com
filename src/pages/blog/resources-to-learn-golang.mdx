For some time, I am fascinated by the [go programing language](https://golang.org/ "Go(lang) programing language") launched by Google in 2009.
I am a person with a scripting language background ([PHP](https://www.php.net/ "PHP programing language") and [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python programing language")) and was motivated to learn a new programing language.

I chose Go(lang) because I wanted to do some system programming with concurrency support.

Because I share my love with my friends and colleagues, I am often asked *How do I start with Go?*, or *Do you got some excellent resources to learn Go?*.
This article is about which resources I used to learn Go.

1. The [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/ "Official A Tour of Go") is the best start. It provides an overview of the syntax and the features in a concise way.
2. The book [Go in Action](https://www.goinactionbook.com/ "Go in Action Book") is an excellent recommendation to get some backgrounds, best practices, pitfalls, and use-cases for language features. Even it is a MEAP, this is worth reading.
3. The guide for golang: [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html "Official Effective Go Guide"). It describes all features with backgrounds and examples.
4. Read foreign go code of projects like [moby](https://github.com/moby/moby "moby project at GitHub"), [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd "etcd project at GitHub") or [termius](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/terminus "terminus project at GitHub").

And of course: Next to this **start your own Go project**.
I recommend starting with it after you finished the [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/ "Official A Tour of Go") and during reading [Go in Action](https://www.goinactionbook.com/ "Go in Action Book").

Some ideas for a project:

* A small rest API (HTTP server)
* A small chat client (sockets)
* A small web/mailing list crawler (concurrency)

Further useful resources are:

* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/ "Go by Example") for example code how to use different features
* [Golang weekly](https://golangweekly.com/ "Golang weekly newsletter") to keep updated on the Go community by email
* [/r/golang](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang "golang subreddit") to follow the Reddit community about Go
* [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts "golang-nuts mailing list") the official golang user mailing list
* [avelino/awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go "awesome-go repository at GitHub") to get a curated list of awesome Go frameworks, libraries, and software

And now: **Have fun** to learn a new programing language!
