Roundabout 75 people showed up.
Dome and I run the Web Engineering DUS meetup for quite some time, and we ask ourselves how we can improve the experience and the value of this event. We try to play around with different formats of the evening, with a broad range of topics, various speakers, etc.</description></item><item><title>Web Engineering DUS Meetup: Satisfaction Survey 2017</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/web-engineering-dus-satisfaction-survey-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 20:19:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/web-engineering-dus-satisfaction-survey-2017/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://andygrunwald.com/img/posts/webengdus-satisfaction-survey-2017/web-engineering-duesseldorf-logo-banner.png"

&lt;p>For a couple of years, I have run the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/" title="Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup">Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf&lt;/a> with the help of a couple of friends (primarily &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milchjieper" title="Dominik Siebel at twitter">Dominik Siebel&lt;/a>).
In August 2017, we &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/messages/boards/thread/51064884" title="Satisfaction Survey Announcement at Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf">created a satisfaction survey and sent it to the group&lt;/a>.
Here are the results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons learned from running a local meetup</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/lesson-learned-from-running-a-local-meetup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/lesson-learned-from-running-a-local-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been organizing the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Duesseldorf/" title="PHP Usergroup Duesseldorf is now Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf">PHP Usergroup Duesseldorf&lt;/a> for about four years now.
A monthly meetup focused on web engineering and new trends in this area.
I do this with a friend, 100% non-profit and motivated by our passion for open source, learning, meeting motivated people, and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last time, many people asked me about my experience and if I can share some tips or what is essential when starting a new meetup (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/756192181677875200" title="Tweet by @andygrunwald if a blog post would be interesting for my followers">and I asked for it&lt;/a>).
In this post, I summarize all of that and provide tips, tricks, and lessons learned.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
