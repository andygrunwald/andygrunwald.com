For a couple of years, I have run the [Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/ "Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup") with the help of a couple of friends (primarily [Dominik Siebel](https://twitter.com/milchjieper "Dominik Siebel at twitter")).
In August 2017, we [created a satisfaction survey and sent it to the group](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/messages/boards/thread/51064884 "Satisfaction Survey Announcement at Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf").
Here are the results.

The survey was anonymous, and **49 people responded in total**.

The first answer was submitted on August 23, 2017, at 13:30:19, the last on November 06, 2017, at 23:48:26.

*Side note*: We run the meetup in the [trivago HQ](https://www.trivago.com/ "trivago") in Düsseldorf.

### What could be improved on the location side?

* More seats
* More parking spaces
* Open the pool table
* Sometimes I hear a noisy fan
* More available power outlets

    title="Web Engineering Satisfaction Survey 2017: Question - The organization is ..." />

### What could be improved on the organizational side?

* Start punctually. Some people come from far away and need to leave on time
* Try to start the talks on-time
* Maybe prepare one or two questions per talk in advance to get the discussion going if there is an awkward silence
* Give an estimate of when the talks start. In case someone is in a hurry, they can skip the networking if desired.

### General Comments

I modified the comments slightly for reading purposes.

    I think all talks should be in English. This is a very international community and especially web engineering is completely English speaking, so German talks put a lot of people off.

    Very nice. I like the ambivalent title of the event. The organizers could improve their English though. :-)

## Speaking about the results

Thanks for all the answers.
We organize the [Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup (WebEngDUS)](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/ "Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup") for you.
And without your feedback, we can't improve.

The results show that we are doing quite okay right now. The location and the organization seem to fit.
Other things, like more parking spaces, we can not influence, but more information and accuracy on the talk duration and the start of the talk can be done and will be done.

The choice of topics seems to be in line as well.
What people want to hear about is spread across all areas.
Sometimes it is hard to get speakers for specific topics, but we will try!
*If you would like to talk about a topic at our Meetup, contact me!*
In the meantime, we continue with the wide are of different topics as we did in the last few years.

The majority of visitors want to learn something and connect with other people by attending the Meetup.
**And this is what we want to achieve**.
**Share knowledge and build a community**.
**This result makes us proud**.
