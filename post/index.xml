&lt;em>THIS&lt;/em>. &lt;em>THIS&lt;/em>. And thousand times &lt;em>THIS&lt;/em>.
I love the pragmatism and _ let&amp;rsquo;s move_ attitude combined with a provoking writing style.
It reminds you how to apply culture and kicks you out of the corporate hamster wheel full of processes and clutter.
A book you should read every year.

Roundabout 75 people showed up.
Dome and I run the WebEngDUS meetup for quite some time, and we ask ourselves how we can improve the experience and the value of this event. We try to play around with different formats of the evening, with a broad range of topics, with various speakers and so on.</description></item><item><title>Migrate your local PHP 7.2 setup to Homebrew v1.5.*</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/migrate-your-local-php-7.2-setup-to-homebrew-v1.5./</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 17:14:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/migrate-your-local-php-7.2-setup-to-homebrew-v1.5./</guid><description>Last week, Hans Puac, a colleague of mine, wrote a small guide into our internal company chat on how to migrate your local PHP environment on macOS to the new Homebrew version 1.5.*. The guide helped a lot of other engineers inside trivago. I thought it might help more people from the internet. I asked Hans if I am allowed to share it, and he approved. So kudos belongs to him.</description></item><item><title>Web Engineering DUS: Satisfaction Survey 2017</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/web-engineering-dus-satisfaction-survey-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 20:19:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/web-engineering-dus-satisfaction-survey-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since a couple of years I run the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/">Web Engineering Meetup Düsseldorf&lt;/a> with the help of a couple of friends (primarly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milchjieper">Dominik Siebel&lt;/a>).

A monthly meetup focused on web engineering and new trends in this area.
I do this with a friend, 100% non-profit and motivated by our passion for open source, learning, meeting motivated people, and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last time, many people asked me about my experience and if I can share some tips or what is essential when starting a new meetup (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/756192181677875200">and I asked for it&lt;/a>).
In this post, I summarize all of that and provide tips, tricks and my lessons learned.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resources to learn Go(lang)</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/resources-to-learn-golang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 10:42:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/resources-to-learn-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since some time I am fascinated by the &lt;a href="https://golang.org/">go programing language&lt;/a> launched by Google in 2009.
I am a person with a scripting language background (&lt;a href="https://php.net/">PHP&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/">Python&lt;/a>) and was motivated to learn a new programing language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose go(lang) because I wanted to do some system programming with concurrency support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I share my love with my friends and colleagues, I am often asked &lt;em>How do I start with Go?&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>Do you got some excellent resources to learn Go?&lt;/em>.
This article is about which resources I used to learn Go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics goes Jacobine</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-goes-jacobine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 12:45:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-goes-jacobine/</guid><description>&lt;p>For quite some time I was looking for a new name for an open source project of mine: &lt;em>TYPO3-Analytics&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am (sadly) not creative in naming things or painting.
The most prominent part of creativity is during development and programming.
To find a name is (in my point of view) very difficult.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics: Release of version v0.1.0</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.1.0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2014 12:51:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.1.0/</guid><description>&lt;p>The project grows and grows :)

&lt;p>Everything started in February 2013.
At this time I studied business informatics next to my fulltime job at &lt;a href="https://www.wmdb.de/">wmdb Systems GmbH&lt;/a> as a software developer (mainly as web developer for &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/">TYPO3&lt;/a> related projects).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics is looking for a new name - suggestions welcome!</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-is-looking-for-a-new-name-suggestions-welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 13:06:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-is-looking-for-a-new-name-suggestions-welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commit/b44dd91e359ad55478919cc94278d26fffbdde03">Apr 19, 2013&lt;/a> I started &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine">TYPO3-Analytics&lt;/a> to create a prototype or proof of concept to make my first steps in fields data mining/software repository mining, statistics, and data visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this time I got an extensive and in-depth knowledge of the &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/">TYPO3&lt;/a> ecosystem (code, people, tools, systems, processes, events, etc.) and the TYPO3 community manager &lt;a href="https://ben.vanten.de/">Ben van &amp;rsquo;t ende&lt;/a> motivated me to create some metrics ;)
So the first project was TYPO3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics: Release of version v0.0.1</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.0.1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.0.1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today i tagged and released version &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/releases/tag/v0.0.1">v0.0.1&lt;/a> of the project &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine">TYPO3-Analytics&lt;/a>.
After &lt;a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=19&amp;amp;m1=4&amp;amp;y1=2013&amp;amp;d2=15&amp;amp;m2=2&amp;amp;y2=2014&amp;amp;ti=on">303 days&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commits/v0.0.1">144 commits&lt;/a> later, i decided to make a &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; and start a new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This version is a first (workable as far as I know) &amp;ldquo;proof of concept&amp;rdquo; for a repository mining platform to produce (community) metrics of various systems.
The first example system is &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/">TYPO3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
