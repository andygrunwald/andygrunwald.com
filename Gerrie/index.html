    ahrefs.com analysis showed that the path /Gerrie[/] is requested and lead to a 404.
    I was not able to find the cause / link to this file.
    However, lets try to be nice to humans who find the link and redirect them to the root.

    An alternative would be to redirect to https://github.com/andygrunwald/gerrie
    This might be reasonable.
    However, this project is not actively maintained anymore.
    Hence, i try to capture the user on my own website.
