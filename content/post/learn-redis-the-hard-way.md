In January this year, I wrote and published an article about our learnings of [redis](https://redis.io/) in production.

The article **[Learn Redis the hard way (in production)](http://tech.trivago.com/2017/01/25/learn-redis-the-hard-way-in-production/)** was published in the [trivago techblog](http://tech.trivago.com/).
