**tl;dr**: We played Rock–Paper–Scissors with 500 people in ~06:40 minutes to kick off a tech conference. It was a well-received energizer game and provided a lot of fun to all attendees.

## _Why_ we did it

Every year, [trivago](https://www.trivago.com/) organizes an event called *[Tech](https://tech.trivago.com/2016/08/02/tech-get-together-2016/) [Get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407f63Df58o) [Together](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=869866313182453)*.
An event with a particular focus on bringing _tech-related_ people from all trivago offices together, get to know each other, and exchange knowledge.
_tech-related_ means Engineers, Data Scientists, Product Managers, Designers, and more.

The major part of this event is a two-day conference with workshops and presentations.
This year (2019), my peer [Wolfgang Gassler](https://twitter.com/schafele) and I were responsible for organizing this conference.
We were thinking about how we can kick off this event.

One week before the conference, I was attending a workshop about _Stress, Resilience, and Conflict Management_ by [Philip Schwidetzki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-schwidetzki-9b38b554/) from [CONTRACT](https://world-of-contract.com/en/).
After lunch, typically, you play quick energizer games to avoid fatigue.
With eight people, Philip played [Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) differently than we were used to it.

The idea was born to **scale this up to 500 people and to start the conference** by this.

## _How_ we did it

We played the standard version of [Rock–Paper–Scissors](#rock-paper-scissors-gameplay).
But how did we scaled this game up to 500 people and finished it in under seven minutes?

{{< figure src="/img/posts/playing-rock-paper-scissors-with-500-people/game-play.png" alt="Rock–Paper–Scissors: The gameplay - Every loser joins the winner as a fan and cheers them up during the next game to continue the winning streak." caption="The gameplay - Every loser joins the winner as a fan and cheers them up during the next game to continue the winning streak.">}}

Every player chose an opponent by random and started playing the first round.
**Every loser of the first round joined their opponent (the winner) as a fan**.
The responsibility as a fan was to support the player by cheering them up during the next game.
The winner searched now for another winner of the previous game and started playing the next game.

By this technique, we divided the crowd by two in every round. In the first round, 250 games happened in parallel, 125 games in the second and so on. The final round has formed by the two winners with 249 fans each in their back.

To execute this with 500 people, we had to apply one organizational trick: **Divide it!**.

{{< figure src="/img/posts/playing-rock-paper-scissors-with-500-people/seating-area.png" alt="Rock–Paper–Scissors: How we divided the location into four areas to play the game with 500 people and used volunteers to help out" caption="How we divided the location into four areas to play the game with 500 people and used volunteers to help out.">}}

We played this game in a big audience room with ~500 seats and enough space at the side.
Space is essential because people need to stand up, move, and find their next opponent.
We divided the room into four areas and assigned two volunteers with experience in facilitation, or agile coaching to one area.
The volunteers don't play the game itself.
They actively push the winning players to their next opponents to avoid groups standing around.
**We executed the gameplay per area with ~125 people until we had one winner per area**.
This procedure led to the final two games with four people in total. After that, we had a winner.

## The final result

It went smooth and better than initially expected.
Due to the split into areas and the helping hands of the agile coaches, the people were able to find their next gaming partner quickly.
**We played Rock–Paper–Scissors with 500 people in ~06:40 minutes**.
Imagine how you would feel to win against 499 people in Rock–Paper–Scissors in only one day?

The feedback from the audience was positive.
Many of them had a lot of fun; it was a quick game, not dull and highly energizing.
Especially when the people start cheering up one person with >= 30 people (the fans!).
**We can recommend this game in a bigger audience.**

> **Fun Fact**: According to [Philip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-schwidetzki-9b38b554/) and his peers from [CONTRACT](https://world-of-contract.com/en/), we are holding the _inofficial_ record of the most players with this game.
Start playing it, record it, and beat it!

## Appendix

## Rock–Paper–Scissors gameplay

You play the game [Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) with one of your hands.
There are three different actions:

* Rock (hand forms a fist)
* Paper (all your fingers are straight)
* Scissor (two fingers form a scissor)

You and your opponent are staying in front of each other.
You count down from 3 ... 2 ... 1, and both come up with one of the three actions by forming your hand accordingly.
Based on the actions, the winner will be determined:

* Scissor beats paper
* Paper beats rock
* Rock beats scissor

{{< figure src="/img/posts/playing-rock-paper-scissors-with-500-people/game-rules.png" alt="Rock–Paper–Scissors: The game rules - Three actions, simple rules." caption="The game rules - Three actions, simple rules.">}}

That is everything you need to play it with two persons.

> If you think this is to easy and you want **more complexity**, have a look at the game extension [*Rock–Paper–Scissors–Lizard–Spock*](https://the-big-bang-theory.com/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/) from the series *The Big Bang Theory*.
