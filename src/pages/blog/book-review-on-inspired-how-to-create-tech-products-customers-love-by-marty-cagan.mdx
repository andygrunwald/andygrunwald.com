Highly recommended, especially if you are working in the tech/internet industry, want to develop your product further, or get insights into this complex role of Product Management.

## Why did I read this book?

The role of [Product Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_management "Product Management at Wikipedia") was vague for me for a long time.
There is no apprenticeship or formal schooling around this profession ([they are now upcoming](https://code.berlin/en/study/product-management/ "Bachelor of Arts in Product Management at CODE university")).
However, during my day-to-day job, I saw successful people in what they are doing while executing the role as a Product Manager, and some are not.
I was never able to say what differs.

I want to get started and gain insights into this role because I love to create products that people can use.
It is always good to know what you are doing and why you are doing it instead of just blind trial and error.
Finally, I want to know what challenges my colleagues are facing daily to understand them better.

## What do I like about this book?

### Content

_INSPIRED_ provides an excellent overview of the role of a Product Manager.
It explains why this role is so important and what makes a good Product Manager.
Furthermore, Marty presents essential pieces like getting the right people on board, a good vision plus strategy, and finally planning-, ideation-, prototyping-, and testing techniques.
For more content-related reviews, check out the one by [Marc Abraham](https://maa1.medium.com/book-review-inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-4fc8e8f26739 "Book review on Inspired by Marc Abraham") or [Damon Allison](https://medium.com/@damonallison/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-a-book-review-513603a8a533 "Book review on Inspired by Damon Allison").

<Quote from="Marty Cagan in _INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love_">
    _The difference between [Product] vision and strategy is analogous to the difference between good leadership and good management. Leadership inspires and sets the direction, and management helps get us there. Most important, the product vision should be inspiring, and the product strategy should be focused._
</Quote>

### Hands-On

The material is practical and delivered in a hands-on fashion.
Nearly all of the presented techniques can put into practice directly.
To master them takes practice.

### People focussed

While concentrating on Product Management, Marty always has the people in mind, too.
He emphasizes how important it is to have the right people, how essential it is to train, motivate and guide them through a change.
He could ignore the people and focus on the hard skills, but he doesn’t.
And this is an essential piece of this book.

### Short chapters

The single sections are pretty short (between one and three pages).
It makes it a quick and enjoyable read.
You can stop and continue everywhere at every time without losing track.

### Writing style

This book can be read from cover to cover or in the form of a reference book.
I like Marty's writing style because he doesn't repeat the same sentence from previous chapters, but you still get enough context about the current section to make use of it.

### Focus on tech

The book writes about Product Management for tech products, but I consider those techniques applicable to other kinds of products.
The methods might need to be adjusted slightly.

### Central theme

Marty emphasizes a recurrent theme throughout the book when it comes to two topics:
1. _The outcome of your work is essential, not the output_
2. _We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries_

## What can make this book better in the next edition?

### More examples

Marty explains techniques like [Story](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/release-management/what-is-user-story-mapping "Article on What is user story mapping?") [Maps](https://medium.com/i-want-to-be-a-product-manager-when-i-grow-up/user-story-mapping-dd7462ee78cf "Article on User Story Mapping") or [Startup Canvas](https://medium.com/@steve_mullen/an-introduction-to-lean-canvas-5c17c469d3e0 "Article about An Introduction to Lean Canvas"), but how do they look in practice?
What are typical mistakes to avoid?
Or [Customer Letters](https://svpg.com/the-customer-letter/ "Article on The Customer Letter") are mentioned as his preferred technique over [Amazon's Working Backward](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management "Quora post about What is Amazon's approach to product development and product management?") with the press release.
It might be super valuable to show an excellent customer letter, and one which is not so good (and why?).
Maybe this is a separate book again.
Moreover, this is left as an exercise to the reader.

### Detailed case studies

Marty has included six case studies from Senior Product Managers out of top tech companies (like [Jane Manning of Google](https://twitter.com/jinpa1345 "Jane Manning at twitter"), [Lea Hickmann of Adobe](https://twitter.com/leahickman "Lea Hickmann at twitter"), [Alex Pressland of the BBC](https://twitter.com/presslandalex "Alex Pressland at twitter") and more).
They are pretty insightful and good reference examples, but they are also very short.
Here, I would love to read more details about it. E.g.,

- What techniques were in use? And why?
- How long did the complete project?
- Maybe positive or critical quotes from project members?
- What would the Project Manager do differently next time if she needs to rerun the same project?

## Would I recommend reading this book?

**Clear yes**.

Especially if you think you have a knowledge gap about what Product Management means.
To be honest: I had no idea what it means to be an experienced Product Manager.
This area is enormous, complex, and challenging.
After reading the book, it was more clear that I missed a lot.
I am also motivated to try various techniques on a smaller scale (e.g., in side-projects).

I recommend this book to everyone who ...

- wants to understand this role more in detail
- is thinking about a career switch into the role of Product Management, or did this recently
- is working in the tech/internet industry and has Product Managers as colleagues
