In January this year, I wrote and published an article about our learnings of [redis](https://redis.io/ "Website of the in-memory data structure store redis") in production.

The article **[Learn Redis the hard way (in production)](https://tech.trivago.com/2017/01/25/learn-redis-the-hard-way-in-production/ "Learn Redis the hard way (in production) at trivago techblog")** was published in the [trivago techblog](https://tech.trivago.com/ "Techblog of trivago").

[Check it out](https://tech.trivago.com/2017/01/25/learn-redis-the-hard-way-in-production/ "Learn Redis the hard way (in production) at trivago techblog")!
