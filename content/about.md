Hi, I am Andy. Nice to meet you.

I am a **Software Engineer from [Duisburg, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/ecvZCGWvtkx)**.
I love the idea of open source, have fun to solve tricky problems and **enjoy working with motivated people**.
Deploy solutions and get them out of the door as well as empower people and share knowledge via mentoring and public speaking, keeps me motivated.

In my current job, I **lead the Software Operations team at [trivago](https://www.trivago.com/)** in [DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/Bq1SdUiESRn). This team is doing Site Reliability and Platform engineering for the hotel search, the core product of trivago.

I **organize the [Web Engineering Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/)** on a monthly basis. This local meetup presents exciting talks about various topics from the web developer community. Feel free to join us next time.
