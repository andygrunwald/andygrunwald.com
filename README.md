My website [andygrunwald.com](https://andygrunwald.com) based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Most of the following chapters are for the future me, who is not able to remember all things.

## Start the server

```sh
$ make serve
```

## Render the (production) site

```sh
$ make build
```

## Start a new blog post

```
$ hugo new post/resources-to-learn-golang.md
```

## Theme

We used [hugo-type-theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-type-theme) as a foundation (thanks for this!).
Sadly, this theme is no longer maintained.
We went from there and modified the original theme for our needs.

### Other themes with a nice design

* [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/)
