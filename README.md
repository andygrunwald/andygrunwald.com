My website [andygrunwald.com](https://andygrunwald.com) based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Most of the following chapters are for the future me, who is not able to remember all things.

## Start the server

```sh
$ make serve
```

## Render the (production) site

```sh
$ make build
```

## Start a new blog post

```
$ hugo new post/resources-to-learn-golang.md
```
