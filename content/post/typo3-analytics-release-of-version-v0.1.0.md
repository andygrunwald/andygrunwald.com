## Did we reach the goal/roadmap for the v0.0.1 release?

In the release of version v0.0.1 we defined some goals for the next release (this one), but did we reach them? Lets check it:

* *code quality*: We have **refactored** many lines of code and extracted them to seperate classes and introduced common **design patterns** like **Factory**. Further more we`ve introduced services like **[scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/)** to get some **numbers about quality**. Standards like **[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** were applied.
* *testing*: **Unit tests** was introduced in this release. The **code coverage** is not very high (**18%**), but 18% are better than nothing! **[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)** was introduced to check the **success** of the unit tests **continuously**.
* *stability*: Many **bugs** were **fixed** (e.g. Fatal error in GithubLinguist-Logging), external **dependencies updated** (e.g. [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) from 1.7 to 1.8), **new components introduced** to make use of proven code (e.g. [symfony/process](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html) component) or **more error checks** added to find some failure faster.
* *flexibility*: The product is now **released under** the **[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)** as a permissive free software license. This product can now be official used in several environments (e.g. commercial). We have **removed hardcoded dependencies** (e.g. TYPO3-Related names in Download\\HTTP consumer) or made **more attributes configurable** (e.g. [CVSAnaly](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY) config) or **support more RabbitMQ queue and exchange features** on consumer / producer level.
* *documentation*: There were **several comments added** to the source code. Every class got a class header comment which **describes** what **the class is responsible** for. Every **consumer** got the **accepted message format** in the docs.

In general, this release and the goals was a success.
One (important) goal was missed: Write more blog posts about the architecture and concepts of this project.
This goal was missed due to the lack of time.
Next to this goal during the development of TYPO3-Analytics another open source project CVSAnaly was improved a lot.
[See the commit history](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commits?author=andygrunwald).
Why? Because TYPO3-Analytics use this tool and we want to use more features of it ;)

## Roadmap for the next release

Currently, there is no strict roadmap for the next release.
But we will try to focus on some things:

* *Find a name*: We are looking for a new name for quite some time (see "TYPO3-Analytics is looking for a new name - suggestions welcome!"). We try to find a new name and apply it to the ecosystem
* *Make it more production ready*: We try to make the product more production ready. How? Add some more error checks, add some checks if the system is production ready, add a proof of concept for a more easier deployment (e.g., on AWS). Ideas welcome!
* *Prove the "productioness"*: We want to start some small analysis of open source projects and create reports for it that other people can see how to use this tool and what is it good for and how amazing, such small piece of code can be.
* *Spread the work*: We want to communicate more (on barcamps, conferences, blogs) about it. We want to try to get more / the first external contributor.

If you want to see some features in it, contact me!

We know that this are hard goals.
We try to reach as much as possible of them.
If you want to support us, see the next chapter ;)

## Be part of the next release

We are looking for motivated contributors to this project.
You do not have to be a programmer.
We are looking for designers, frontend people, people for communication, people who got new ideas or want to push some further analysis.

If you do not have (spare) time for this, we are looking for sponsors as well.
If you want to push some results, we would be proud to welcome you as a sponsor :)

**If you do not know how to contribute or how to get into it**: I **will offer workshops (for free!)** for TYPO3-Analytics, **how this works**, about the **architecture,**, about the **goal**, about the **motivation** or about **stuff you are interested in**.
I can offer rooms in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany for it with internet connection for this.
If you are interested, just ping me as well.

If you are interested just contact me via Twitter ([@andygrunwald](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald)) or by e-mail ([github profile](https://github.com/andygrunwald)).
