The guide helped a lot of other engineers inside &lt;a href="https://www.trivago.com/" title="trivago">trivago&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it might help more people from the internet.
I asked Hans if I am allowed to share it, and he approved.
So kudos belongs to him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resources to learn Go(lang)</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/resources-to-learn-golang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 10:42:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/resources-to-learn-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p>For some time, I am fascinated by the &lt;a href="https://golang.org/" title="Go(lang) programing language">go programing language&lt;/a> launched by Google in 2009.
I am a person with a scripting language background (&lt;a href="https://php.net/" title="PHP programing language">PHP&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/" title="Python programing language">Python&lt;/a>) and was motivated to learn a new programing language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose Go(lang) because I wanted to do some system programming with concurrency support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I share my love with my friends and colleagues, I am often asked &lt;em>How do I start with Go?&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>Do you got some excellent resources to learn Go?&lt;/em>.
This article is about which resources I used to learn Go.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
