Hi, I am Andy. Nice to meet you.

I am a **Software Engineer from [Duisburg, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/ecvZCGWvtkx)**.
I love the idea of open-source, have fun solving tricky problems, and **enjoy working with motivated people**.
Empower people and sharing knowledge via mentoring and public speaking keeps me motivated.
