A monthly meetup focused on web engineering and new trends in this area.
I do this with a friend, 100% non-profit and motivated by our passion for open source, learning, meeting motivated people, and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last time, many people asked me about my experience and if I can share some tips or what is essential when starting a new meetup (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/756192181677875200">and I asked for it&lt;/a>).
In this post, I summarize all of that and provide tips, tricks and my lessons learned.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
