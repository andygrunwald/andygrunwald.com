&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong>: When your app interacts with an external system (e.g., a database), &lt;strong>assign a name to the connection&lt;/strong>.
The goal should be: &lt;strong>the external system knows who you are&lt;/strong>.
It will reduce the time to debug by multiple hours and often save other applications from failing during an incident.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The last time, many people asked me about my experience and if I can share some tips or what is essential when starting a new meetup (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/756192181677875200" title="Tweet by @andygrunwald if a blog post would be interesting for my followers">and I asked for it&lt;/a>).

&lt;p>Everything started in February 2013.
At this time, I studied business informatics next to my full-time job at wmdb Systems GmbH as a software developer (mainly as a web developer for &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/" title="TYPO3 Content Management System">TYPO3&lt;/a> related projects).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics is looking for a new name</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-is-looking-for-a-new-name-suggestions-welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 13:06:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-is-looking-for-a-new-name-suggestions-welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commit/b44dd91e359ad55478919cc94278d26fffbdde03" title="Initial commit of the Jacobine project at GitHub">Apr 19, 2013&lt;/a> I started &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine" title="Jacobine at GitHub">TYPO3-Analytics&lt;/a> to create a prototype or proof of concept to make my first steps in fields data mining/software repository mining, statistics, and data visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this time, I got an extensive and in-depth knowledge of the &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/" title="TYPO3 Content Management System">TYPO3&lt;/a> ecosystem (code, people, tools, systems, processes, events, etc.) and the TYPO3 community manager &lt;a href="https://ben.vanten.de/" title="Website of Ben vant Ende">Ben van &amp;rsquo;t ende&lt;/a> motivated me to create some metrics ;)
So the first project was TYPO3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TYPO3-Analytics: Release of version v0.0.1</title><link>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.0.1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andygrunwald.com/blog/typo3-analytics-release-of-version-v0.0.1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today i tagged and released version &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/releases/tag/v0.0.1" title="v0.0.1 of Jacobine">v0.0.1&lt;/a> of the project &lt;a href="https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine" title="Jacobine at GitHub">TYPO3-Analytics&lt;/a>.
After 303 days and 144 commits later, I decided to make a &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; and start a new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This version is a first (workable as far as I know) &amp;ldquo;proof of concept&amp;rdquo; for a repository mining platform to produce (community) metrics of various systems.
The first example system is &lt;a href="https://typo3.org/" title="TYPO3 Content Management System">TYPO3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
