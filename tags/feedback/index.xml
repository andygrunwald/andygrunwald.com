Roundabout 75 people showed up.
Dome and I run the WebEngDUS meetup for quite some time, and we ask ourselves how we can improve the experience and the value of this event. We try to play around with different formats of the evening, with a broad range of topics, with various speakers and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
