For quite some time I was looking for a new name for an open source project of mine: *TYPO3-Analytics*.

I am (sadly) not creative in naming things or painting.
The most prominent part of creativity is during development and programming.
To find a name is (in my point of view) very difficult.

There are some names of projects I like because of the sound like [Flynn.io](https://flynn.io/) or [hood.ie](http://hood.ie/).
At 3rd March 2014, I wrote a blog post about this challenge to use the power of the community: TYPO3-Analytics is looking for a new name - suggestions welcome!

Next to this blog post, I got on my girlfriend's nerves with the recurring questions like "What do you think about name x? Or y?".
And I asked my twitter timeline many times and wondered how for example Apache chose names for their product.
They [got rules for product names](https://www.apache.org/dev/project-names.html), but I did not find a resource which describes the story about this names.
[Ingo](https://twitter.com/irnnr) [mentioned](https://twitter.com/irnnr/status/449367546211221504) that [Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) is one of the project founders’ kid’s toy pet’s name.
[Scott](https://twitter.com/shirleman) [suggested](https://twitter.com/shirleman/status/449614357022773248) Donk, because it was his stuffed donkey's name as a kid :D
Anyway.

I thought a lot about possible names and talked to many people.
Some of the ideas were *Vizben*, *Benvis*, *Mevis*, *Pinocchio*, *Gepetto*, *Viva con analysis*, *Knock.io* and so on.
Nothing special.
Nothing "good" enough.
Nothing I like at the first time.
I continued my search.
During a lunch break, I talked to my colleagues [Jan](https://twitter.com/janvanthoor) and [Dominik](https://twitter.com/milchjieper) about this topic.
Jan mentioned that I might have to choose a general topic which I focus on for the name search.
He suggested mining.
I liked the idea and started my research in the mining area ...

## The new name: *Jacobine*

I was born and live in [Duisburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duisburg).
Duisburg is a small town in [North Rhine-Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia) and part of the Ruhrgebiet.
Duisburg is very popular for its steel industry and coal mining (see the [Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landschaftspark_Duisburg-Nord) or a [list of coal mines in Duisburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_von_Bergwerken_in_Nordrhein-Westfalen#Duisburg)).
In 1855 an English company started to build a new mine called *Jacobine*.
It was located in Duisburg-Meiderich near to [Oberhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberhausen).
In 1859 the mine have to shut down because water damaged it.
11 years later, in 1870, the mine was repaired.
In 1871 the mine was put into production again under a new name Schacht 1.
Schacht 1 was part of the bigger mine [Westende](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeche_Westende).

Dominik mentioned that the name *Jacobine* got a bad taste because it was damaged and has to be shut down.
Dominik is right, but the mine was repaired and put into production again.
I would agree Dominik that *Jacobine* is a bad name for a management software or something in this area.
But we do not build a management software ;)
And one important fact: I like the new name.
It is unique in the software world (as far as I know), it got a relation to the central area of the tool we build ([data]mining) and a relationship to my lovely town Duisburg (but of course contributor from other cities and countries are welcome as well :)).

**So let's try to get not damaged by the water :)**

## Migrate your TYPO3-Analytics clone

If you got an existing clone of the project with the old name TYPO3-Analytics you have to migrate the git repository to keep up to date.
Here we go:

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin git@github.com:andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics.git (push)

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:andygrunwald/Jacobine.git

$ git remote -v
origin git@github.com:andygrunwald/Jacobine.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:andygrunwald/Jacobine.git (push)
```

Please pay attention to the name of your remote (origin or maybe [upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)) and the protocol you use (*git://* or *https://*).

The ecosystem around *Jacobine* (the [web frontend](https://github.com/andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics-Web), the [vagrant machine](https://github.com/andygrunwald/TYPO3-Analytics-Vagrant) and the [chef cookbook](https://github.com/andygrunwald/chef-typo3analytics)) will be renamed in the next days.

If you got any problems or need help to migrate your clone, I will help you as much as possible.
Just add a comment, send a tweet ([@andygrunwald](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald)) or send me an email.

PS: Thanks to all people who were involved in finding a new name and attending all the discussions!
PPS: And thanks to [Georg](https://twitter.com/georg_ringer), [Lena](https://twitter.com/ffffux), [Ben](https://twitter.com/benvantende) and [Ola](https://twitter.com/misprintedtype) who attend my [last survey on twitter](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/458286697416245249) regarding *Jacobine* or *Jacob* (self made abbreviation for *Jacobine*) - 3:1 for *Jacobine*!
